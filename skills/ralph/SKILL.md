# Ralph PRD Converter

Converts the latest existing PRD to the prd.json format that Ralph uses for autonomous execution.

---

## The Job

Take the latest created PRD from ".ralph/tasks/" directory (markdown file or text) and convert it to `prd.json` in your ".ralph/" directory.

---

## Output Format

```json
{
  "project": "[Project Name]",
  "branchName": "[prefix]/[name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description from PRD title/intro]",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1",
        "Criterion 2",
        "Typecheck passes"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## Story Size: The Number One Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE Ralphy iteration (one context window).**

Ralphy spawns a fresh AI tool instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a story is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces broken code.

### Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" - Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" - Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" - Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big.

---

## Story Ordering: Dependencies First

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must not depend on later ones.

**Correct order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data

**Wrong order:**
1. UI component (depends on schema that does not exist yet)
2. Schema change

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Must Be Verifiable

Each criterion must be something Ralphy can CHECK, not something vague.

### Good criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `status` column to tasks table with default 'pending'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
- "Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog"
- "Typecheck passes"
- "Tests pass"

### Bad criteria (vague):
- "Works correctly"
- "User can do X easily"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

### Always include as final criterion:
```
"Typecheck passes"
```

For stories with testable logic, also include:
```
"Tests pass"
```

### For stories that change UI, also include:
```
"Verify in browser using dev-browser skill"
```

Frontend stories are NOT complete until visually verified. Ralphy will use the dev-browser skill to navigate to the page, interact with the UI, and confirm changes work.

---

## Branch Naming Convention

The `branchName` prefix depends on the **type of work** described in the PRD:

| Type | Prefix | When to use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| New feature | `feat/` | New functionality, new UI, new API endpoints |
| Bug fix | `fix/` | Fixing broken behavior, correcting errors |
| Hot fix | `hotfix/` | Urgent production fix, critical bug |
| Chore | `chore/` | Refactoring, CI/CD, tests, dependencies, configs, documentation |

**Examples:**
- New notification system → `feat/notification-system`
- Fix broken login flow → `fix/login-redirect-loop`
- Urgent security patch → `hotfix/sql-injection-user-search`
- Update CI pipeline → `chore/github-actions-cache`
- Add missing tests → `chore/api-endpoint-tests`
- Refactor database layer → `chore/db-layer-refactor`

**How to determine the type:** Read the PRD title, description, and goals. If it introduces new user-facing functionality — it's `feat/`. If it fixes something that's broken — `fix/` (or `hotfix/` if marked as urgent/critical). Everything else (refactoring, tooling, tests, CI, configs, docs) — `chore/`.

---

## Conversion Rules

1. **Each user story becomes one JSON entry**
2. **IDs**: Sequential (US-001, US-002, etc.)
3. **Priority**: Based on dependency order, then document order
4. **All stories**: `passes: false` and empty `notes`
5. **branchName**: Determine prefix from work type (see Branch Naming Convention above), then append the feature name in kebab-case
6. **Always add**: "Typecheck passes" to every story's acceptance criteria

---

## Splitting Large PRDs

If a PRD has big features, split them:

**Original:**
> "Add user notification system"

**Split into:**
1. US-001: Add notifications table to database
2. US-002: Create notification service for sending notifications
3. US-003: Add notification bell icon to header
4. US-004: Create notification dropdown panel
5. US-005: Add mark-as-read functionality
6. US-006: Add notification preferences page

Each is one focused change that can be completed and verified independently.

## Example

**Input PRD:**
```markdown
# Task Status Feature

Add ability to mark tasks with different statuses.

## Requirements
- Toggle between pending/in-progress/done on task list
- Filter list by status
- Show status badge on each task
- Persist status in database
```

**Output prd.json:**
```json

## Archiving Previous Runs

**Before writing a new prd.json, check if there is an existing one from a different feature:**

1. Read the current `prd.json` if it exists
2. Check if `branchName` differs from the new feature's branch name
3. If different AND `progress.txt` has content beyond the header:
   - Create archive folder: `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
   - Copy current `prd.json` and `progress.txt` to archive
   - Reset `progress.txt` with fresh header

**The ralphy script will prompt the user interactively** when it detects a branch mismatch at startup (offering to switch branches, remove the old PRD, or quit). If you are manually updating prd.json between runs, archive first.

---

## Checklist Before Saving

Before writing prd.json, verify:

- [ ] **Previous run archived** (if prd.json exists with different branchName, archive it first)
- [ ] Each story is completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] Stories are ordered by dependency (schema to backend to UI)
- [ ] Every story has "Typecheck passes" as criterion
- [ ] UI stories have "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as criterion
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable (not vague)
- [ ] No story depends on a later story
